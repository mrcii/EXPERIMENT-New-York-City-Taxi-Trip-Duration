# EXPERIMENT-New-York-City-Taxi-Trip-Duration

In the **Database System Concepts** course in 2017 fall semester, we were asked to conduct research on any cutting-edge field pertaining to Database System. As the leader of a group of eight students, I was lucky enough to combine this course project with my interest in urban data.

[Tony-HYX](https://github.com/Tony-HYX) led this experienment. I forked this repo from him and just modified the Readme file.

### Database System Group Project: Big Data Analysis and Applications in Smart Cities

### 数据库小组课题|智慧城市中的大数据
#### 实验：纽约市出租车载客数据分析 - Kaggle

The output folder contains the gmap html files.
